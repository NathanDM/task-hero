# task-hero

Simple task manager with ambitious stack.
[Progressive web application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

Definitely not production ready.

This is only a small personal project aimed at trying to get a neat stack to
build a progressive web application.

## Stack

### Front

- ES6 ✓
- React ✓
- Flux
- Gulp (v4.0 alpha) ✓
- Sass
- Electron

### Back

Intending to add Node.js server a little further down the line, before toying with
service workers
